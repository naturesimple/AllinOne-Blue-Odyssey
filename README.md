Putting almost everything in life in the same app is bound to be the next direction of development. All functions are put in one app. The basic skeleton of the app consists of:    
1 intelligent automated and secure privacy browser, based on chrome and selenium  
Must modify the browser's menu, button. And let the browser call the graphics card in the local device, etc., so that the browser can automatically create the virtual working environment required by the user in the local operating system or in the remote virtual cloud service. Allow the browser to schedule the database in the local machine to achieve persistence, and allow the browser to implement note display and editing functions at the same time. Let the browser dispatch any other app locally.  

2 notes system      
3 complex multiple types of databases, including sql and nosql and vector databases and graph databases    
4 Generative AI, similar to chatgpt, realizes the creation of text, images and videos
